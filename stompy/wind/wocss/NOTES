How available are the necessary data?

In winds.dat:

surface wind inputs: 10 stations, fairly broadly distributed.

then a sounding wind speed ( utm 569000  4173000 )
a sounding at the same location, labeled JU230512.OAK, sounds a lot like
oakland airport?  second sounding has temp, Td, and pressure
And the wind data is repeated...

 - http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/ might provide the sounding data

ds=xr.open_dataset('raob_soundings25653.cdf',decode_times=0)

- nice! - it has twice daily sondes.  just picked a random period in spring 2013,
  and got 150 profiles.
